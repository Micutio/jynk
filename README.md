# jynk - Java Interpreter for ynk

## About ynk itself

The programming language ynk is part of the object-oriented crowd and developed
following the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com).
It's primary purpose is to explore concepts of language and compiler/intepreter design.
Meanwhile, despite broadly following the book's specification  of the **Lox** language,
ynk will attempt to distill it's own unique features that extend beyond the scope of
the book.
